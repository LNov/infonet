# infonet

*infonet* is a Python software package developed to:
1) Validate network inference algorithms based on multivariate trasfer entropy. This package was used to generate the results and plots published in [1].
2) Investigate the relationship between network structure and information dynamics, in particular transfer entropy. This package was used to generate the results and plots published in [2], linking pairwise transfer entropy to network motifs.
3) Compare the performance of bivariate and multivariate network inference algorithms. This package was used to generate the results and plots in [3], where we studied how well different algorithms can capture fundamental network properties (as compared to ground-truth structural networks with different topologies). 

To get started, have a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/LNov/infonet/wiki).
