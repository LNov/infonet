# infonet

*infonet* is a Python software package developed to:
1) Validate network inference algorithms based on multivariate trasfer entropy. This code was used to generate the results and plots published in [1].
2) Investigate the relationship between network structure and information dynamics, in particular transfer entropy. This code was used to generate the results and plots in [2], linking pairwise transfer entropy to network motifs.

To get started, have a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/LNov/infonet/wiki).
